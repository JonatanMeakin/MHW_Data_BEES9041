Physical dataset : For data extracted from "IMOS - SRS - SST - L3S - Single Sensor - 1 day - night time - Australia"

SST = Seas Surface temperature in °C
lon = longitude in °E
lat = latitude in °N
time = time in days (since 1990)


Biological dataset : For data extracted from "IMOS - SRS - MODIS - 01 day - Chlorophyll-a concentration (OC3 model)"

chl_oc3 = chlorophyll-a in g/m3
time = time in days (since 1990)
longitude = longitude in °E
latitude = latitude in °N


Chemical dataset : For data extracted from "IMOS - combined geochemical parameters (reference stations)"

SampleTime_Local = time at which sample was measured in Maria Island, Tasmania
latitude = latitude in °N
longitude = longitude in °E
SampleDepth = depth at which sample was take in m
SampleID = sample reference number
Oxygen_umolL = oxygen concentration in umol/L
Nitrate_umolL = nitrate concentration in umol/L
Phosphate_umolL = phosphate concentration in umol/L
Silicate_umolL = silicate concentration in umol/L
